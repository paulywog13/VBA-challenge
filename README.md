# VBA-challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to create a VBS Code that would extract information from multiple worksheets in a workbook dealing with Stock Data. The data we needed to find out was how the price changed from the start of the year to the end of the year for each stock, identify if the stock value increased over the year, calculate the total volume of trades of each stock over the year, and then as an additional challenge we needed to determine which stock increased value the most, which stock decreased the most, and which stock had the greatest volume of traded for each year. 

* The first step in the code was to identify what variables we would need in our code. 
* Next I assigned the headers and challenge labels for the summary and challenge tables.
* Then I determined which values needed to be identified prior to starting my loop function.
* The following step was the most difficult as it was creating the loop function that would extrapolate and consolidate the data needed for each individual stock and how to assign the data to the summary table.
* Included in the loop function I needed to assign the color values to the stock price percentages to more easily identify which stocks increased in value and which stocks lost value over the given worksheet year. 
* Finally I added a second loop function for the challenge table identifying the stock with the greatest growth in value, the stock with the greatest loss of value, and the stock with the greatest volume of trades over the given worksheet year.

Hopefully you appreciate my code and please let me know if you have any suggestions on how I could improve it or make it more efficient.
